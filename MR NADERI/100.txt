	It is generally assumed that find the job opportunities serves an important role after academic path and in the future of individuals life. While some people might hold that college students should find their favorites and study their interest without thinking about future job, others do disapprove of this opinion, asserting that students should be prepare their skills for careers where there are more job opportunities. In my opinion, college students should earn skills which need to find a good opportunities. For the reasons which will be elaborated in detail in the following paragraph.
For first and foremost the crux of the matter lies in the fact that students in the college should follow the new skills which order in the society every day. In simple terms our city or country, regularly in our society, job careers claim some specific skills in every period. Actually I think, not only college educational board member should provide new update skills but also students should detect modernize skills. As a case in point, many old jobs like bakery or carpentry are transformed this days and they are not in demand. Thus, student must think in present day and find their position in current situation of works.
Another equally importatnt point to consider is college students could find a field of study which is close to their favorites. although they are learn new courses in the college, they step in their interests. Basically when students picked their favorite area of study, they would succeed in their job matters. Precisely speaking students should select their interests before college era. For example, Maryam Mirzakhani was an Iranian mathematician who loved math in school age period, she followed her favorites, then she succeed and she had been professor of one of the best universities in the world. I think so, parents and educational instructor should make students familiar with new area of job opportunities.
