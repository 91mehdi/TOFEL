now days education (higher education) plays an important role in 
an individual's everyday life (job prospect, decisions, economic state, welfare, ...)

2- do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

teachers have played pivotal roles in development of every society.
in this line they truly deserve to treated with higher respect (moltivator).
one of the questions regarding this (in this area) is whether educators(tutors, instructors) are losing respect from their students (pose a question).

    offering quality courses really matters when it comes to students education in higher degrees.
university authorities (university executive board, educators, educationlists, academicians) need to
make sure  (ensure) the young receive high quality education. a controversial question which is often raised regarding  this idea is whether universities should continue only traditional courses. while some believe that learning and should be the only way of teaching. i am of the opinion that oneline courses can be a credible (reliable) 
alternative to face-to-face classes. i will justify my view point hereunder.
