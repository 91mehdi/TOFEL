Sample question-----------------------
--------------------------------------
1- do you agree wit the following statement? all high
school students should take a course in basic economics.

now days education (higher education) plays an important role in 
an individual's everyday life (job prospect, decisions, economic state, welfare, ...)
since (because, as) it widely affects various aspects of life (motivator.
one of the question usually (often, recently) raised regarding education is
curriculum (pose a question). i contend that this decision is quite reasonable (rational)
(thesis statement). the folling reasons would cogently illustrate this points (blueprint).

2- do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
young people* nowadays* do not respect their teachers* as much as they did in the past* !

    it goes without saying that since the dawn of civilization,
teachers have played pivotal roles in development of every society.
in this line they truly deserve to treated with higher respect (moltivator).
one of the questions regarding this (in this area) is whether educators(tutors, instructors) are losing respect from their students (pose a question).
some people are inclined towards the opinion that in general teachers enjoying their positions and reaciving more respect compared to the past.

3- do you agree with the folling statement?
universities should offer online courses.

make sure  (ensure) the young receive high quality education. a controversial question which is often raised regarding  this idea is whether universities should continue only traditional courses. while some believe that learning and should be the only way of teaching. i am of the opinion that oneline courses can be a credible (reliable) 
alternative to face-to-face classes. i will justify my view point hereunder.

do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
young people should try several different jobs before they take a long term careers.

first body paragraph-------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first remarkable point to be mentioned is that selecting an occupation for course of life
may hinder the opportunity for youngesters to pursue their own interests. It is axiomatic that
even a lucrative job which easily pulls inexperienced individuals in to might not be
in line with one's attitude,values, preferences and life goal. moreover, owning a wrong job
confilicting with people's personality may adversely affects their satisfaction. engaging more in than
one occupationmay lead in discovering our talent, interests and values.
according to recent survey conducted in my country, satisfaction rate of employees are associated with
their former job experiences. the workers who felt strongly unfulfilled at workplace where at
the their first jobs while the other who were indicated as satisfied workers had already engaged in
many careers path. the first group of participants confessed that had not chosen their job mindlessly years ago,
they would have taken a job upon well suited with their traits. consequently, in order to
be content and fulfilled in workplace, certainly before selecting a life-time job, it is of greate importance
for unskilled people to involve in more than one job. in this context, they can consider whether the jobs
fit into their lives and match with their characteristics.


another reason which deserves some words here is that experiencing multiple jobs provides
an effective communication and networking skills. such invaluable experience certainly
helps the young to be open to many perspectives and also people with diverse backgrounds.
undeniably, working in different contexts, young people pragmatically learn vital strategies
to effectively communicate with others. having this craft, they can equip themselves to
build and strengthen their relationship with colleagues, employers and clients which result in
outstanding professional development. an example will illustrate this viewpoint much better.
working years through in various temporary professions as an accountant, market analyst and
public relations manager, my father partically broadend his own perspective about individuals
in various sectors of a company and possible issues they are likely to encounter in their to-do list.
finally, once he landed his last positio as a senior manager of a big mechanich company,
he quickly build rapport with his new colleagues and straightforwardly oversaw his own team members
with ranging functions in production, marketing and finance departments. as a result, his refreshing
attitude motivated all team to boost the company's profitability and they consequently won 
tremendous success in the short run. had not worked in different proffesions, he would not
have owned basic knowledge about a wide varity of perspectives and tasks to make and effective manager
to delegate work smoothly.

question -------------------------------------
in times of an economics crisis, in which area should, goverments reduce their spending?
1. Art
2. Scientific research
3. Parks and public gardens

clarifying -----------------------
    to begin with, I am of the opinion that goverment officials should allocate more money to the services which are highly contributed
to solving  the financial issues in the tough times. to put it in other word, the legislators need to jumpstart the economy by investing
in bot art and research innovations as they can stimulate it bu creating job opportunities. in this vein, they should undoubtedly cut down
the expenditures on parks since they are fully discretionary and luxury, unlike research and art.

results -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    furthermore, when the economics affairs neccessitates goverments belt-thightening, they should consider the most serious
drawback of downsizing academia and art. to be more specific, reduced job opportunities could result in scientifics and artists
emigrating to more welcoming corporative climates, with the danger of a "brain-drain" looming. it may even worsen the recession
and lengthen its period since the bright minds would leave the economy to enter more flourished ones.

fact -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    first and foremost, investing on research and art tremendously boost employment rate in economics crises. In fact, in every
economy, a great deal of people are either employed or seeking jobs in these sectors.

    economic downturn catastrophically impacts many facets of every society.

    practical research develops economies.
    
    many countries witness a catastrophically rise in unemployment during economic crisis.

results --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    in addition, raising funds for practical research and development can help to mitigate devastating effects of the financial crash
as it brings innovations and technologies to the economy.

    allocating financial resources effectively to research and academia can result in a decent return.

    investing in parks and recreational centers can take away some of the financial stress and pressure as it draws international tourists.

    furthermore, national parks suffer from profound impacts of economics failure which can decrease the number of international tourists.
investing in parks whit the aim of luring tourists can be an effective solution for crucial issue.

    also, goverments should grant companies in the research and development sectror with exceptional financial need to be able to survive
in the hard rime.

    the decline in the investment could cause significantlasting (far-reaching, disastrous, severe, devastating, catastrophic)
environmental impacts on national parks.

    if country parks and the other toursim attraction are founded by goverments wisely, it will not only help people get rud of extreme stress
but also lure international tourists and generates income for local businesses and enterprises.

    morover, goverments can attract the bright mind to businesses by investing in research and development to create more exceptional financial opportunities.
this strategy can propel (lead) savvy enterprenuers to actively get involved in community since they would survive and protect their own
businesses by innovations during the uncertain time.

necessity ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

since (as) most people lose their jobs and unemployment rate increase during economic depression, families appear to be more unstable.

moreover, individual's health and welfare can be adversely (drastically, dramatically) affected by the loss off a job (necessity).

therefor, goverments need to have short term strategies such as investing more in national parks to engendera few local businesses and
open up some career opportunities to hire the unemployed.

not only do people ;ose their income, but also the situation leads to damaging inter-familiy relationship.

whether to solve the social issue or to overcome financial ones, budget constraints should not reduce the expenditures
on research and art to stimulate the enterprenuers to invest and employ in both sectors.

do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
its a waste of money for goverment to fund space travel or space exploration
give specific examples and details to support your answer.

the technologies designed by the sector dramatically expand our knowledge and enrich our every day lives.

this investment broadens our horizons about ourselves and our universe. just imagine we are not alone in this universe and
there are aleins surrounding our little plant. although it would look like nonsense and far-fetched to have a space war, as
featured in sci-fi movies, it is wise enough to know our possible neighbors and discover the adjacent habitable exeplanets to 
land and colonize.

our living planet will tum to be a better place to live, not only because of all the newborn technologies which
we will use to the betterment of life, but also because we are developing a far heartfelt appreciation of our earth, lif, and human beings.
(may feel deeper, profound, sincere, genuine gratitude for)

to be fully effective, goverment needs to urgently look into its monetary resources to ensure highly demanding areas such as public education is
not facubg kace if budget.

every dollar spend in the business could be paid beck through the values of the created works (developing technologies) and revenues.

this is the single-most important investment we could possibly make to overcome the upcoming issues such as
climate change and its dramatic profound impacts on our globe, we cannot ignore the importance of other subjects completly though.

this increased investment in science and exploration through last decade have helped to address the grave problem that 
confront man in our times such as climate change.

probably some are convinced to accept the idea that this could give us nothing except some pretty pictures of the plant below.

adequate funding of space missions provides impetus to well-rounded technologists to generate ideas that can be useful in other scuebces as well.

this is no less of a priority to put forth the space missions as they have a quantifiable impact on our lives.

if it has advanced enough, we can move to the other plants and settle as our own plant is going to face global warming.

this in turn generates a market for other goods and services as goverment pays for astronauts and other people who are 
involved in this industry.

close supervision of government is required to reduce the threat of bankruptey of the industry.

circling the globe at a high altitude, satellites can monitor a large variety of factors including crop yields, drought, precipitation,
floods and forest fires. take for an example, t certainly can help to increase the crop yields bu an equvalent of many billions of dollars.

spending lots of time on our home plant, NASA now monitors signs of climate change, such as melting ice and rising waters which helps to
 adopt coherent policies to take wise action on climate change throughout the world.

incentivizing young people who where no longer interested in science, this industry helps to solve the big issues of the world.

i personally see the distribution of the food to the needy as an important problem, but still completely different

furthermore, it returns funds to the government through taxation which can be expended in infrastructures.

this business can return every dollar contributed bu the government to the nation in terms of the value of the jobs generated.

one of the fastest-growing sectors of the developed countries economy isspace exploration as it hires angel capitalists amd ventire capitalists.

this business also creates employment for people around the world.

as astronauts inspire and motivates the young to study science, technologies, engineering and mathematics, it fortifies the other indusrties such as higher education

before investing a penny in that sort of extremely demanding areas, government needs to make sure every vital sectors of the economy is 
performing as expected.

in this world where milion of people around the world suffer from war, disease, hunger, persecution
, discrimination, environmental degradation and natural disasters, spending public money on that sort of enterprises seems irrational.

they simply can raise the funds the industry needs by incentivizing companies and venture capitalists.

the voyage to space always fire the imagination and spairs human beings to ecpend their knowledge and better their effects.

in my opinion, sufficient support for any type of research projects must be provided and space exploration is not an exception.

government should not blow a tone of money without any care while the national debt is too high (while the poor are suffering from farmine.)

space exploration allows scientifics to precisely monitor and study various kind of natural disastrous in a large spatiotemporal scale.

instead they should invest in other innovative technologies such as farm mechanizations to battle farmine and migration which
 both are results of poor agriculture and unferile lands.

this is certainly an inappropriate use of governments limited resources as it can be allotted for boosting public infrastructure such as education services.

poor quality of education is one of the many risks that threats every individual in this competitive world.

vigorous education system definitely is an intangible asset for every economy.

the government has played a pivotal role in developing the world's most successful system of research and development.

scientific and technical enterprise has expanded dramatically.

space exploration has produced enormous benefits for people living on earth including weather forcast, agriculture, national defense, health, and social well-being.

space research need greater involvement by government.

to illustrate, governments should leave this adventure for private parties and venture capitalists and instead focus on more imperative issues.

governments need to wisely manage their spending for science and technology across disciplines and government agencies.

well developed countries are also benefited substantially from this active involvement in space exploration.

government needs to ensure that a sufficient proporation of the national budget is allocated to exploring other space.

where the world's space agencies invest billions of dollars in space research, my country is far behind in the industry.

to achieve the desired phase of development, my country needs to take immediate and progressive steps in this area as
 every dollar spend on the industry returns milions to the economy.

government needs to pull the plug and spends our national resources elsewhere as it is absolute (complete) waste of them.

we exploit the very technologies primarily created by space agencies in our every-day lives such as solar cells and shock absorbers.
although, these technologies once had designed to apply during space missions, later on other sectors adopted them to use for different
purposes. for instance, shock absorber protect both shuttle during launch and buildings in area prone to earthquake.
