make sure  (ensure) the young receive high quality education. a controversial question which is often raised regarding  this idea is whether universities should continue only traditional courses. while some believe that learning and should be the only way of teaching. i am of the opinion that oneline courses can be a credible (reliable) 
alternative to face-to-face classes. i will justify my view point hereunder.
