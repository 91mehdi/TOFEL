2- do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
young people should try several different jobs before they take a long term careers.

first body paragraph-------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first remarkable point to be mentioned is that selecting an occupation for course of life
may hinder the opportunity for youngesters to pursue their own interests. It is axiomatic that
even a lucrative job which easily pulls inexperienced individuals in to might not be
in line with one's attitude,values, preferences and life goal. moreover, owning a wrong job
confilicting with people's personality may adversely affects their satisfaction. engaging more in than
one occupationmay lead in discovering our talent, interests and values.
according to recent survey conducted in my country, satisfaction rate of employees are associated with
their former job experiences. the workers who felt strongly unfulfilled at workplace where at
the their first jobs while the other who were indicated as satisfied workers had already engaged in
many careers path. the first group of participants confessed that had not chosen their job mindlessly years ago,
they would have taken a job upon well suited with their traits. consequently, in order to
be content and fulfilled in workplace, certainly before selecting a life-time job, it is of greate importance
for unskilled people to involve in more than one job. in this context, they can consider whether the jobs
fit into their lives and match with their characteristics.


another reason which deserves some words here is that experiencing multiple jobs provides
an effective communication and networking skills. such invaluable experience certainly
helps the young to be open to many perspectives and also people with diverse backgrounds.
undeniably, working in different contexts, young people pragmatically learn vital strategies
to effectively communicate with others. having this craft, they can equip themselves to
build and strengthen their relationship with colleagues, employers and clients which result in
outstanding professional development. an example will illustrate this viewpoint much better.
working years through in various temporary professions as an accountant, market analyst and
public relations manager, my father partically broadend his own perspective about individuals
in various sectors of a company and possible issues they are likely to encounter in their to-do list.
finally, once he landed his last positio as a senior manager of a big mechanich company,
he quickly build rapport with his new colleagues and straightforwardly oversaw his own team members
with ranging functions in production, marketing and finance departments. as a result, his refreshing
attitude motivated all team to boost the company's profitability and they consequently won 
tremendous success in the short run. had not worked in different proffesions, he would not
have owned basic knowledge about a wide varity of perspectives and tasks to make and effective manager
to delegate work smoothly.
